Wine Quality 

This project analyzes a dataset of white and red wines from Vinho Verde, Portugal. In 2009, local scientists conducted an extensive inventory of wines, meticulously documenting their characteristics. In an extraordinary gesture of scientific collaboration, they made this detailed dataset publicly available, enabling researchers worldwide to gain insights into wine quality and composition.

Total Samples: 6,497 wines
